## Steps to start project
* how would you start project : npm init -y
* what packages needs to be installed - express , nodemon (dev), jest (dev), supertest(dev)
* Create server and test folders
* add server/app.js and modify packagejson "main" key
* Modify start and test script
* Run npm start, npm test
* create folders : routes, controllers, utils, test, data in server
* create test files in test folder


## server/app.js
* import express
* listen on port 3000
* ensure server starts without any error

## server/ routes/post_routes.js
